      "I have been working in the Mental Health field for over 20 years in a variety of settings. I have had several years experience working with teenagers in Residential Treatment Center's, and have worked with clients of all ages in day treatment, outpatient clinics, and private practice. I use an individualized therapeutic approach to help people work through their struggles, stress, and other issues that have caused problems in their day to day life. I specialize in working with teenagers, college-aged, and adults.",
      // I use a variety of methods and techniques to help support and work with people achieve the goals they want to accomplish. I use a strength-based, supportive approach to help work through anxiety, depression, trauma, PTSD and other challenges people face.
      // I am starting a new practice and have openings for new clients. I will be working evenings and Saturday mornings. I can meet in person or by videoconference/telehealth.",
